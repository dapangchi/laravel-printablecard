            <h4>RockDesign.com Updated: Jan 1, 2015</h4>

            <h2>1. WELCOME</h2>
            <br/>
            <p>Welcome to RockDesign.com. By using the RockDesign.com website to create and order a Product, you (the Client) are entering into a legally binding agreement between RockDesign.com and yourself based on these Terms and Conditions. It is the Client&rsquo;s responsibility to carefully read these Terms and Conditions before using this website. The Client&rsquo;s use of the RockDesign.com website is contingent upon their agreement and acceptance of the RockDesign.com Privacy Policies, as well as the following Terms and Conditions. If the Client does not wish to be bound by these Policies and Conditions, they should not access or use the RockDesign.com website or services. RockDesign.com has the right to modify the Terms and Conditions at any point in time without any notice to the Client. </p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
        
            <h2>2. PRODUCTION AND PRINTING DEPARTMENT</h2>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            
            <h2>2.1 PROOFS</h2>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>A digital proof of work will be submitted for the client&rsquo;s approval prior to being sent for printing. The client is then responsible for carefully reviewing the proof and order prior to submission in the interest of avoiding errors. Once an order is accepted and confirmed by the Client, no liability is accepted by RockDesign.com for any errors not noticed or corrected by the Client on the proof. RockDesign.com will not accept any changes to an order that has been confirmed and sent to printing. Should the Client choose to ask RockDesign.com to print the Product without their review or approval, RockDesign.com will not be responsible for any flaws, errors, or problems of any sort on the Product, and a re-print option will not be available. If The Client chooses to upload a file, we strongly recommend that The Client submits a print-ready file in vector format with all text outlined. Any modifications made to files by RockDesign.com to get them print ready may be subject to design fees on a case by case basis. As such, RockDesign.com is not responsible for any errors in the Product, including but not limited to: misspelling, bleeds, grammar, damaged fonts, low quality images and graphics, punctuation, crop marks, transparency, overprint, incorrect colours, insufficient safe margins, etc. </p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h2>2.2 COLOUR</h2>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>While all reasonable efforts will be made to ensure colour accuracy, RockDesign.com does not guarantee that an exact colour match will occur between the Client&rsquo;s artwork, imaging, files, or previously printed materials due to inherent variations in the printing process. There is a 10% colour shift that may occur due to press calibrations in printing, and colour may shift during the course of a single press run or between separate runs.
            <br/>
            <br/> RockDesign.com also cannot guarantee colour matching a preview or sample as it appears on a Client&rsquo;s monitor as we cannot compensate for individual display colour variances. It is highly recommended that all designs and files be created in a CMYK colour format in order to decrease the likelihood of colour shifts occurring if a conversion from RGB to CMYK is necessary. It is possible to convert a RGB file into CMYK if the client is unable to provide one, however, many of the colours in RGB are not reproducible in a CMYK format and RockDesign.com does not guarantee any colour accuracy when doing such a conversion. We highly recommend that the Client provides the pantone colour codes when doing spot colour printing. </p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h2>2.3 TURNAROUND TIME</h2>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>The turnaround times posted by RockDesign.com are for printing, and only begin after the Client has sent approval for the digital proof. The Client must acknowledge and agree that all listed turnaround times are estimates only and do not include shipping time. These times are calculated as business days and do not include weekends or holidays. </p>
            <p>Unexpected failures, malfunctions, and / or technical problems with (printing) equipment may delay the printing process. If such a delay were to occur, RockDesign.com may, at its discretion and on a case by case basis, provide compensation in the form of re-print discounts or expedited shipping. Technical difficulties or delays will not be grounds for order cancellations or refunds. </p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h2>2.4 SHIPPING</h2>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>Printed orders are to be shipped out anywhere within 7-20 business days, dependant on product. Shipping dates are calculated based upon estimates provided by the shipping companies utilized by RockDesign.com, and there is no way of guaranteeing any delivery dates including rush orders. RockDesign.com is not liable for any delays in delivery caused by shipping companies, international customs issues, or any other circumstance beyond the direct control of RockDesign.com. </p>
            <p>Shipping companies require a physical address and a valid phone number in order to deliver a package, as they do provide a door to door service. PO Box addresses are not valid for delivery. In the event that a package is not delivered due to an error with the address provided by the Client, RockDesign.com will reship the package with the correct address and the Client will be responsible for any additional shipping fees. Product deliveries are subject to the corporate policies of the shipping company, and any policy put in place by those companies will apply to the Client. If the Client is not present at the provided delivery location, it is their responsibility to collect the package in accordance with the policies of the applicable shipping company. </p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h2>2.5 SHIPPING TARIFFS / SALES TAX</h2>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>All orders with a specified delivery address within Canada are subject to the Federal Goods and Service Tax, and may additionally be subject to a Provincial Sales Tax or a Harmonized Sales Tax based on location. It is the responsibility of the client to cover all additional taxes applied to each shipment.</p>
            <p>Any order being delivered outside of Canada may be subject to import taxes, customs duties, and fees levied by the recipient&rsquo;s country. The Client is responsible for all such Import Fees and any additional charges for all taxes and customs clearance. Customs policies and Import Fees vary based on country and cannot be determined or controlled by RockDesign.com. </p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h2>2.6 ORDER CANCELLATIONS, RETURNS, OR REFUNDS </h2>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>Due to the custom nature of the products sold by RockDesign.com, an order cannot be cancelled or modified once it has been approved by the Client and has been sent into production. Partial refunds may be available on orders that have begun processing but have not yet gone into production, and will be determined on a case by case basis. If a partial refund will be given, the refund will be calculated based on the portion of work that has not yet been completed. Any design charges will still be applicable if the Client decides not to print after the design has been created. </p>
            <p>Custom designs and artwork generated internally by the staff of RockDesign.com are subject to human error. If an error occurs in regards to pricing, stock, coating, turnaround time, or any other aspect of an order that is deemed to be at the fault of RockDesign.com staff, RockDesign.com maintains the right to cancel the order and provide a full refund to the Client. Alternatively, any miscommunication that occurs from the Client to RockDesign.com during the quoting process will not qualify the order for cancellation or refund. If any changes are made to an order, it will be viewed as a secondary order and will not qualify as a reprint. </p>
            <p>In the event that a project is inactive for more than 60 days with no response from the Client, RockDesign.com reserves the right to deduct a 20% cancellation fee from the order price if the project is cancelled and a refund is issued to the client. </p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h2>2.7 REPRINTS</h2>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>A reprint will only be honoured if a shipping or printing error occurs. Shipping errors occur when a package is damaged or lost after being accepted by the shipping provider. In the event that a shipping error occurs, the Client is required to contact the shipping provider to open a file through them. Shipping providers require adequate evidence to approve a claim, and it is the Client&rsquo;s responsibility to provide proper proof (tracking number, pictures, samples, etc) for the shipping provider. Once the file is opened with the shipping provider, RockDesign.com can file a claim to receive compensation. If the claim is not approved by the shipping provider, and / or RockDesign.com is not compensated, then it is at the discretion of RockDesign.com if a reprint can be honoured. Reprints for shipping errors will take a minimum of 2 weeks for approval after the Client has contacted the shipping provider as shipping claims take 2 weeks to process.</p>
            <p>Printing errors are classified as misprints or trimming issues that are caused by mistakes in the production process that are outside of machine error values. Machines are maintained and calibrated to function properly, and any shifts that occur with a product within these values will not be grounds for a reprint. A 0.125” bleed is requested on all print files to account for any shifting that may occur. If there is a shift of 2 mm or less, there will be no grounds for a reprint. Additionally, there is potential for a 10% colour shift on products between runs. An order will not qualify for a reprint if there is a 10% colour shift from a previous order. </p>
            <p>The same file will always be used during the reprint process. If the Client requests any changes to the file, this will be considered a new order. Upon initial review of the design, RockDesign.com will email the Client any warnings about potential problems that may occur during printing. This email will be sent out during the proofing process, and it is the responsibility of the client to review these warnings prior to accepting the proof. If a proof is accepted and approved without any changes being made to the potential problem areas, RockDesign.com will not accept any responsibility if the listed errors occur during printing, and a reprint will not be honoured in these situations.</p>
            <p>All complaints regarding print defects must be brought to the attention of RockDesign.com within 10 business days of the receipt of order to be considered or reviewed for a reprint. If no contact or claim has been made within 21 days, the work shall be deemed to have been received, checked, and accepted by the Client as fully complying with the accepted order specifications. In case of printing errors, contact orders@rockdesign.com with a description of the print defect. The email will must contain 2 high resolution images attached for review; one showing a close up of the defect area, and the other showing 20 samples of the product with the same issue. A minimum of 5% of an order needs to be affected by the same printing error in order to qualify for a reprint. RockDesign.com retains the right to request the full product be returned at their cost for evaluation if deemed necessary. In the event that a product has been printed incorrectly at the fault of RockDesign.com, a full reprint with be provided to the Client at no additional cost. </p>
            <p>Turnaround times for reprints will be the same as all standard turnaround times. Shipping will be determined by RockDesign.com on a case by case basis. </p>
            <br/>

            <br/>
            <p>Coupon Codes must be submitted by the Client at the time of order placement, and cannot be applied towards an order after the payment has been received.

            <br/>

            <br/>
            <p>Full payment is required prior to any orders being processed through to production.

            <br/>
            <h2>3.1 COMMITMENT</h2>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>The RockDesign.com Design Department will follow company procedures at all times. These include but are not limited to; providing a high level of design work, the correct number of revisions, adhering to specified turnaround times, etc. </p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h2>3.2 DESIGN SERVICE</h2>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>All pricing provided on the website or through staff quotations will be calculated based on in-house printing through RockDesign.com unless otherwise stated. In the event that the client chooses to take the final design and for printing elsewhere, additional design fees will be applied to the order unless stated otherwise.</p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h2>3.3 REVISIONS</h2>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>The purpose of providing an official revision is to assist the Client in the design process. The goal is to create a logo and / or design that the Client finds satisfactory to their needs. Official revisions are used only for small modifications, typographic edits, changes to the colour palette, and additions to the provided design (proofs). A revision does not include a complete re-design or additional designs (proofs) provided to the Client. </p>
            <p>During the revision process, RockDesign.com staff may request additional information from the Client. If this content is not supplied, or there is no response to the request, RockDesign.com may, after a period of time, and at its discretion, place the project on hold and discontinue any work on the project. RockDesign.com will not be held accountable for any deadlines missed or changes in a projected and communicated timeline due to such delays. If a project has been on hold for 60 days with no response from the client, the file will automatically be closed and no refund will be given. </p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h2>3.4 CANCELLATIONS AND REFUNDS</h2>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>It is possible that through the course of a design project the creative efforts of the Designer do not align with the expectations of the Client. In the event that the Client wishes to cancel a design project before completion, a partial refund may be considered. Design fees are based on the time spent in development of concepts and not a specific result. Therefore, design fees are still applicable in varying amounts based on work completed, even if a finalized product has not been made. </p>
            <p>RockDesign.com retains the right to terminate a project completely, at any time, at their discretion. Reasons for such a termination may include but are not limited to: abusive or abrasive language, poor communication, etc. </p>

            <br/>

            <p>All templates shown on the website and provided to the Client for use are owned exclusively by RockDesign.com. The Client is prohibited from reselling the template or reusing it for a different design. In the event that the Client chooses to take the design created from the template and print externally, there will be additional fees charged to the Client at RockDesign.com&rsquo;s discretion.</p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h2>3.6 DESIGN OWNERSHIP</h2>
            <br/>
            <br/>

            <p>RockDesign.com suggests that all approved logos be trademarked. Trademarking services are available to the Client at an additional fee through a third party law firm.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the Client agrees that all content provided to RockDesign.com is free from any existing copyrights by a third party. Such content does not have to bear a copyright notice in order to be protected by a copyright law. Therefore the absence of a copyright notice does not insure the right to reproduce such protected material.

            <h2>3.7 SAVED DESIGNS</h2>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>Due to the high number of files created and received, RockDesign.com does not save old files internally. Files attached to orders will be removed 1 month after the file is uploaded.
